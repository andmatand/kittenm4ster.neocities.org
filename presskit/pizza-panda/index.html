    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <i>PIZZA PANDA</i> is a peppy pizza-delivery platformer for the PICO-8
      fantasy console. Players take on the role of a panda who drives a
      cartoonishly agile car, jumping around small vertically oriented
      cityscape-style levels in order to collect pizza and deliver it directly
      into the mouths of various animals who are sticking their heads out of
      the windows of buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each level presents the photographs of one or more animals to which the
      player must deliver the pizza, some of them wearing hats which the player
      must correctly place upon the animals' heads in order to make a valid
      delivery. There are also baby rats crawling on the roofs of some
      buildings which must be collected and delivered to their papa without
      letting them be eaten by cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to accomplish these things, the player stacks pizzas, hats, and
      baby rats on the roof of the car and traverses the level, either touching
      or avoiding certain NPCs. Finding an efficient route through each level
      is encouraged through the use of a target time; if the player completes
      all the objectives of a level within the target time, a gold star is
      awarded for that level.
    </p>

    <h2>Unique Qualities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Invents its own mechanics&mdash;arrived at via
        experimentation&mdash;rather than just copying existing mechanics from
        other games
      </li>
      <li>"Put the correct hat on the animal" mechanic
        <ul>
          <li>
            jump up from underneath hat to grab it from NPC's head
          </li>
          <li>
            hat sits on top of car and stacks on top of other hats or pizzas
          </li>
          <li>
            descend onto another NPC's head to place hat on head
          </li>
          <li>
            place the hat on the correct NPC's head to match "photos" in upper
            left corner
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Designed to be fun without being frustrating, while  still providing an
        optional route-optimization challenge for those who  want to 100%
        everything and find all the secrets
      </li>
      <li>
        Player cannot lose or get into a "fail state" (except on two levels
        which are a little bit more puzzly and may require restarting the level if
        things are delivered in the wrong order)
      </li>
      <li>
        No combat or violence
        <ul>
          <li>
            the one exception to this is that the cats   will "eat" a mouse which causes the mouse to respawn in its original position
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Large game by PICO-8 standards, but still fits in a single 32 KB "cart"
        <ul>
          <li>
            various compression and data serialization techniques were
            developed in order to fit everything
          </li>
          <li>
            some details are available in <a

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Smooth 60 FPS movement (not visible in GIFs) and detailed animations
        (especially for PICO-8 standards)
      </li>
      <li>
        Music is an original funk/jazz fusion version of <em>Funiculì,
          Funiculà</em>, known affectionately to some Spider-Man 2 (2004)
        players as the "pizza song"
      </li>
      <li>
        Dedicated horn "beep" button
      </li>
      <li>
        "You can slam dunk a whole-ass pizza straight into a cute aminal's
        mouth"
      </li>
      <li>
        kittenm4ster's largest and most "commercial" game yet
      </li>
      <li>
        Made as a passion project over the course of 3 years (of spare time)

    </ul>

    <h2>Game Structure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        20+ levels (20 normal levels, 1 overworld level, 1 credits-only level,
        1 secret overworld level containing 3 hidden bonus levels, 1 other
        hidden bonus level)
      </li>
      <li>
        Each level has one or more of the following goals:
        <ul>
          <li>
            collect all pizza slices (each group of 8 slices turns into a pizza
            pie)
          </li>
          <li>
            deliver pizza to the animals pictured in the "photos" shown in the
            UI
          </li>
          <li>
            swap hats on NPCs in order to match the photos (if an NPC is not
            one of the intended recipients, it will begin to eat the pizza but
            then spit it out, such that time is the only penalty)
          </li>
          <li>
            pick up baby rats and deliver them safely (without touching cats)
            back to the "papa" rat
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        For players who want more challenge, each level has an optional
        target-time
      </li>
      <li>
        Player is awarded a star for each level
        <ul>
          <li>
            silver star: level completed in any amount of time
          </li>
          <li>
            gold star: target-time reached
          </li>
          <li>
            after achieving a gold star on all levels, "nite mode" is unlocked:
            replay the levels at night with an even lower target time which
            awards a secret star-type
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        On the credits level, a silver/gold/nite-mode trophy is awarded based
        on star completion
      </li>
      <li>
        Player can control the character immediately from the title screen
      </li>
      <li>
        Overworld structure: in-engine platforming to select levels
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Unsolicited Praise from around the Internet</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "This game is really, really satisfying to play[...] the movement feels
        great, it's fast and slippery, yet intuitive and easy to get used to. I
        also like how there isn't one set path to take through any given level,
        and you can come up with your own route. Phenomenal work"
        &mdash;speedrunner who playtested the game before release
      </li>
      <li>
        "This is great! Very smooth movement. Cute animations, good sound. The
        controls are pretty fun and the game gets a little puzzly towards the
        end."
