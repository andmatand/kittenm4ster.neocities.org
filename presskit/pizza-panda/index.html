    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <i>PIZZA PANDA</i> is the only platformer ever made in which you are a
      panda driving a car and the goal is to slam-dunk whole pizzas straight
      into the mouths of cute aminals as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanics in <i>PIZZA PANDA</i> were arrived at via experimentation
      rather than just trying to clone existing games; as a result it's a bit
      hard to explain with just words.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay Video</h2>

      (sorry; i tried to go slow on the levels but it's really hard for me
      to play it badly lol hopefully you get the idea at least)

    <h2>Feature Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"Put the correct hat on the animal" mechanic
        <ul>
          <li>
            jump up from underneath hat to grab it from NPC's head
          </li>
          <li>
            hat sits on top of car and stacks on top of other hats or pizzas
          </li>
          <li>
            descend onto another NPC's head to place hat on head
          </li>
          <li>
            place the hat on the correct NPC's head to match "photos" in upper
            left corner
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Physics-based delivery mechanic
        <ul>
          <li>
            touch pizza to NPC's head to deliver pizza
          </li>
          <li>
            touch baby rat to papa rat to return it safely home
          </li>
          <li>
            inventory items stack and bounce on top of car
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Player cannot lose or get into a "fail state"
        <ul>
          <li>
            (except on two levels which are a little bit more puzzly and may
            require restarting the level if things are delivered in the wrong
            order)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessibile game-design
        <ul>
          <li>
            fast-paced play, though encouraged, is entirely optional
          </li>
          <li>
            level timer can be hidden
          </li>
          <li>
            delivering the pizza to the wrong animal is not punishing; the
            animal simply spits the pizza back out, such that the only penalty
            is time (if you are trying to acheive the target time)
          </li>
          <li>
            secret levels can be discovered without requiring high-level play
          </li>
          <li>
            mostly textless
          </li>
          <li>
            no reading is required to complete the game
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        No combat or violence
        <ul>
          <li>
            the one exception to this is that the cats will "eat" a rat which
            causes the rat to respawn in its original position
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Large game by PICO-8 standards, but still fits in a single 32 KB "cart"
        <ul>
          <li>
            various compression and data serialization techniques were
            developed in order to fit everything
          </li>

    <h2>Game Structure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        20+ levels (20 normal levels, 1 overworld level, 1 credits-only level,
        1 secret overworld level containing 3 hidden bonus levels, 1 other
        hidden bonus level)
      </li>
      <li>
        Levels are selected in an overworld with levels being locked until
        the previous level is completed
      </li>
      <li>
        Each level has one or more of the following goals:
        <ul>
          <li>
            collect all pizza slices (each group of 8 slices turns into a pizza
            pie)
          </li>
          <li>
            deliver pizza to the animals pictured in the "photos" shown in the
            UI
          </li>
          <li>
            swap hats on NPCs in order to match the photos (if an NPC is not
            one of the intended recipients, it will begin to eat the pizza but
            then spit it out, such that time is the only penalty)
          </li>
          <li>
            pick up baby rats and deliver them safely (without touching cats)
            back to the "papa" rat
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        For players who want more challenge, each level has an optional
        target-time
      </li>
      <li>
        Player is awarded a star for each level
        <ul>
          <li>
            silver star: level completed in any amount of time
          </li>
          <li>
            gold star: target-time reached
          </li>
          <li>
            after achieving a gold star on all levels, "nite mode" is unlocked:
            replay the levels at night with an even lower target time which
            awards a secret star-type
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        On the credits level, a silver/gold/nite-mode trophy is awarded based
        on star completion
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Unsolicited Praise from around the Internet</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "This game is really, really satisfying to play[...] the movement feels
        great, it's fast and slippery, yet intuitive and easy to get used to. I
        also like how there isn't one set path to take through any given level,
        and you can come up with your own route. Phenomenal work"
        &mdash;speedrunner who playtested the game before release
      </li>
      <li>
        "This is great! Very smooth movement. Cute animations, good sound. The
        controls are pretty fun and the game gets a little puzzly towards the
        end."
        &mdash;reddit user
      </li>
      <li>
        "i loved the puzzles in this game!! the whole game was so cute and fun
        :))"

      <li>
        "super balanced with creative puzzles and rock-solid gameplay."

        &mdash;lexaloffle BBS user
      </li>
      <li>
        "This is super adorable. More games should have a 'put the correct hat
        on the animal' mechanic IMO." &mdash;lexaloffle BBS user

    <h2>Game Credits</h2>
    <p>
      All graphics/animation/music/design/programming/etc. is by "kittenm4ster"
      (Andrew Anderson) except his wife helped a little bit with drawing the
      trees.
    </p>

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      Andrew "kittenm4ster" Anderson has been making games as a hobby since the
      age of 9 when he learned to program using QBASIC. He discovered PICO-8
      shortly after it was first released in 2015 and has been quietly
      creating some of the most popular cult-classic games for the platform
      including
      <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=29353">Feed the Ducks</a>,
      <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=34959">Alfonzo's Bowling Challenge</a>,
      <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=35492">Ghost House</a>,
      <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=30966">Orbiter Suite</a>,
      and even a
      <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=30759">simulated disk defragmenter</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through sheer luck and no action of his own, kittenm4ster's work has been
      featured in
      <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bowl-a-perfect-game-in-the-funny-free-alfonzos-bowling-challenge/">PC Gamer</a> in both digital and print,
      and he was unexpectedly approached by Ford Motor Company about the
      possibility of developing a game for their in-vehicle entertainment
      system one time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew is a full-time software engineer living in Eugene, Oregon with a
      wife, two kids, and a dog. He doesn't know anything about marketing or
      whatever but some people on the internet said you should make a press kit
      if you want to have a chance of ever getting your game covered by anybody
      so this is his attempt at making one.
